# Issue Tracker

A JIRA-like issue tracking application I built as a practice, featuring [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). The project is not entirely completed, however the core functionality is fully working and every feature (done or yet to be done) is created as a task in the initial database seed. So you can see all the tasks from building the app in the app itself. 

## Installation

To run the project, follow the install instructions in `client` and `server` directories.
